# MCMCSpectra

As our final project in PHYS321, we look at absorption lines in the Sun's spectrum. We use a dataset collected in March 2023 for PHYS258, containing 30 spectra from both the Moon reflection (N=15) and the sky (N=15). We use advanced MCMC fitting techniques and find two precise absorption wavelengths that agree with literature values.
